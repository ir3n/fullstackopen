This repository contains my solutions and exercises from the **Full Stack Open** course by the **University of Helsinki**.

The course focuses on modern full-stack web development using technologies such as JavaScript, React, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, and related tooling, with an emphasis on best practices and real-world application development.

All exercises in this repository are my work, completed as part of the course.
